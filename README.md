Tutorials
=========

A set of 2D Game tutorials made using Unity.

We try to share anything we learn while creating [Stormsword](http://github.com/stormsword/stormsword) that we think other developers might be interested in!

# Our tutorials

1. [Command Stack](command-stack) - a simple to maintain Artificial Intelligence method for controlling characters or enemies in your game capable of complex behaviors.

# Installation and setup

Our tutorials are created using [Unity v4.5](http://unity3d.com/unity/download) and generally require no extra tools. 

Each tutorial has a .scene file located in the `/Assets` directory to get started. Additionally, each tutorial has a README which links to our [Dev Blog](http://stormsword.net/category/dev-blog/) where the tutorial text is posted.
